1)   this -- it is a key word which segrigate the instance & parameterized variables 
             it point out the current object ,  pointiong towards instance variables
             
     super -- it is a key word which is used to call the base class method in  derived class
              it donesnot have limitations to define , if we doesnot metion it java compiler will take the parametrized or local variable
              

     this() -- it is a method used to define the current method of parent class
            
     super() -- it is a method used to call constructor of parent class, it must be define in first statment of the constructor
                if we doesnot mention the super method java compiler will directly point out the default constructor of parent class
              
     scp -- string constant pool it is a part of heap area  , it store the constants only , it stores the objects creating through literals  


2)   object oriented programing is nothing but the structure to write a programe , meanwhile we can create object using this concepts
      inheritance , polymorphism , encapsulation , abstraction 


3)   extends --  it is a keyword  ,  by using this keyword we can achive inheritance  , it transfer all the states and variables of one class to another class 
                  it is used between two classes
     implements -  it is a keyword used to achive abstraction , it transfer a state of an interface to clas with some implimentations 
                   it is used between class and interface

4) * when we use the primitive datatypes it is not purely object orintend 
   *we must write the program with that structure only


6) polymorphism -- an object is behavioring diffrently  in a given instance of time ,  we can also  call the method of child class by createing object child class of refrence 
                   of parent  class it also known as up casting 


9) class -- it is keyword , it is a blue print to create objects , it consist of states & behaviours , it create only once , it cannot occupy memory ,  it can call many times 
   object -- it is instance of a class , it is to create multiple classes , it can be created n number of times , it ocuupy heap memory , it can be call of once for an object

10) no memory is ocuupys for class
11) two types of constructor
     1. default constructor - the constructor with no parameters is calles default constructor
     2.  parametrized constructor -- the constructor with parameter is called parameterized constructor

12) no we cannot run java application without oops concept because every class is inherited with the root class (object class)


13) consider a raw material  of iron initialy it dont no what it be done it is nothing but interface  , later it can we converted into a tool  
      then it is a abstraction class  , the method without body is called abstrct method ,  inerface makes some implimentations in a class is called abstraction

14) runtime polymorphism -- the method call is decided at run time is called run time polymorphism ,  we can achvie runtime polymorphism by method overiding , 
                             it must need two clases
    compile time polymophism  -- the method call is decided at compile time is called compile time polymorphism ,  we can achive it by method overloading , 

15) primitive(int , byte , short , char , boolean , float , double , long) & nonprimitive(class , System ,  string etc)
