1.   
public static void main(String a[])
== public is a acess modifier we can call the method from anywhere by using this access modifier
static is a variable & void is a return type main is the pre defined method name & String is a 
class in java a[] is the array so this is totally called  as main method in java

class & object
== class is blueprint & object is a instance of a class class is not physically available but the object is available , 
object is store in heap area but class is store in outside the heap area , class is access through class key word 
but objrct is creted as ---classname refrenceVariable = new Classname(); ,class contains method & object contains constructor


jvm , jre , jdk 
== jvm is the java vertueal machine which provieds runtime environment to the byete code , and the working of jvm is loads the byte code ,
verify the byte code & exicute the byte code 
jre -- jre is the java run time environment it contains jvm + set of libraries
  the part of jre is only to execute not for write the code 
jdk -- jdk is the java development kit & it is also called as the fully featured development kit it contains
jre+development tools(compiler , debugger) & it is also for write the code & exicute the code


4. 
     constructor -- it is a same as method withod any return type & same name as class name 
         constructor can be created as "className()"  , if we didnot crete the constroctor the compiler will cretate the constructor 
          for a class , it has two types 1.default constructor 2.parameterized constructor 
        1.default constructor -- constorctor without any parameter is called defalut constructor
        2.parameterized constructor -- constructor with parameter is called parameterized constructor 



5  
    this - it is a key word uesd to seperate the instance & static variable 
    this() - it is a predefined method in java


6.
     main method is static because static variable data can be shared so that to exicte all the method in a 
      programe we must call all the methods in main method , there are two type 
      1.preDefined -- the methods are created by jaVA IS called predined method
      2. userDefined -- the method which can created by users to create method there is a syntax i.e
         <access modifier> <returntype> methodname();
       returnType can be void , primitive datatype ,  non primitive datatype


8.   

      javaclass loading is in the jvm it loads the  byte code to jvm  

10.  No, we cannot do the constructor as private when we made it as private we wont fetch the data from that class
       yes, constructor can be overloaded 
     ex-    public Shop()
          public Shop(int size)

11.   No,  we cannot use the instance variable through static method , we will define them in constructor
